I really liked this grapefruity IPA called [Yellow Rose](https://www.lonepint.com/the-core-brews) back in TX.  (I can't get it up here in WA.)

Discussion [here](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/mosaic-s-m-a-s-h-yellow-rose-clone.494127/),
another recipe [here](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/yellow-rose-smash/).

My Recipe:
- 6 gallons water @ 152°F
- 13.5 lbs pilsner malt grain, mashed for 60m
- 0.5 oz Mosaic @ 30m
- 0.5 oz Mosaic @ 15m
- 2 oz Mosaic whirlpooled at 170°F
- [Imperial Flagship A07](https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/ale/flagship/)
  (was told similar to [White Labs California Ale WLP001](https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=101&type=YEAST&style_type=0))
- 3 oz Mosaic dry hop for 3 days
